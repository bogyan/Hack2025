This hackathon was organized by MasterCard in collaboration with our student club – Data Science at the Warsaw School of Economics.
Our goal was to clean and preprocess a transactional dataset, then build a machine learning model that predicts whether a given transaction is genuine or fraudulent. We also evaluated the model's performance using standard metrics.
The results of our work are presented in the attached PDF, and the code is available in the accompanying Python file.
Please note that the dataset was of relatively poor quality, which impacted the model’s accuracy. Nonetheless, the project offered valuable hands-on experience in working with real-world data and fraud detection models.
